## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the World Happiness Report dataset (pre-2019). The analysis aims to clean the data, handle missing values, and visualize trends in global happiness.

## Benefits to the Industry
This analysis can help governments, policymakers, and organizations understand the key factors that contribute to happiness in different countries. By identifying these indicators, policies can be tailored to improve the well-being of citizens, leading to more prosperous and happier societies.

## Python Libraries Used
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy`: For numerical operations
- `plotly`: For creating interactive visualizations
- `matplotlib`: For basic plotting
- `seaborn`: For statistical data visualization
- `sklearn`: For KNN imputation (handling missing data)

## Target Audience
- **Data Analysts**: Those looking to sharpen their skills in data cleaning and EDA.
- **Policy Makers**: Interested in understanding how different metrics (e.g., GDP, life expectancy) influence happiness.
- **Researchers**: Looking for insights from global happiness data to inform further studies.
- **Students**: Learning about data science, data cleaning, and visualization techniques.
